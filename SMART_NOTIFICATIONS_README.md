## 📱 How to Use

### **For Users:**

1. **Permission Setup**: First launch asks for notification and location permissions
2. **Trip Creation**: Creating trips automatically sets up relevant notifications
3. **Real-time Alerts**: Receive contextual notifications based on:
   - Trip timeline (packing, check-in, departure)
   - Location changes (arrival at destination)
   - Weather conditions (alerts for severe weather)
   - Activity scheduling (upcoming planned activities)

### **For Testing:**

Navigate to **Settings > Demo Notifications** to test:
- **Trip Reminder**: Simulates departure notifications
- **Location Alert**: Simulates arrival at destination
- **Weather Alert**: Simulates weather-based notifications

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### **Notification Types:**
```typescript
type NotificationType = 
  | 'trip_reminder'      // Departure, packing, check-in alerts
  | 'location_arrival'   // Destination arrival notifications
  | 'weather_alert'      // Weather-based travel alerts
  | 'activity_suggestion' // AI-powered activity recommendations
  | 'general'            // General app notifications
```

### **Priority Levels:**
- **High**: Trip departures, severe weather alerts
- **Normal**: Location arrivals, activity reminders
- **Low**: Activity suggestions, general updates

### **Smart Triggers:**
1. **Time-based**: Scheduled reminders for trips and activities
2. **Location-based**: Geofence triggers for destination arrival
3. **Weather-based**: Real-time weather condition monitoring
4. **Context-aware**: AI suggestions based on location and preferences

## 🔧 Configuration

### **Notification Permissions:**
- **Foreground notifications**: For immediate alerts
- **Background location**: For location-based triggers
- **Push notifications**: For remote alerts

### **Location Tracking:**

## 🎯 Smart Features

### **Automatic Trip Setup:**
When you create or update a trip:
